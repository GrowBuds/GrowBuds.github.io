## Plants are family, too.

## Get to know them better.


LetUmGrow is a social network for plants located on the UH Manoa Campus.

Looking for a specific plant or want to learn more about a plant that you've seen? Our interactive map the location of nearby plants and links to each plant profile.

See a new plant? Create a new profile page for that plant and add updates to its feed, like pictures or statuses. Who knows, there might even be a reward waiting for you if you do!
